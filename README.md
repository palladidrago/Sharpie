* Make mashov login optional, only when trying to see the grade page and isn't logged in.
* Make grades page look better, calculate average of grades on a test with firestore.
* Figure out a proper day to get the daily schedule (With regurarly updated excel sheet or json in the database maybe)
* Fix the app logo.
* Make the mashov not send an email because it thinks I'm logging in from a new device.
