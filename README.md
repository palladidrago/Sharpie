* Home screen: fix tabs, add assignment tab. 
* Fix the main page, credentials don't work at all.
* Wrong mashov credential handling.
* Move the language button to the settings page (or remove it entirely)
* Make mashov login optional, only when trying to see the grade page and isn't logged in.
* Make grades page look better, calculate average of grades on a test with firestore.
* Figure out a proper day to get the daily schedule (With regurarly updated excel sheet or json in the database maybe)
* Fix the app logo.
* Make the mashov not send an email because it thinks I'm logging in from a new device.
